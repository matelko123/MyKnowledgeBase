# Output Caching in .NET Core Web API using Minimal API Architecture

Caching is an essential technique to improve the performance and responsiveness of web applications by reducing the load on databases or external services. In .NET Core Web API, output caching allows developers to store the response output and serve it directly from the cache for subsequent requests, reducing the need to recompute the response.

In this guide, we will explore how to implement output caching in a .NET Core Web API project using the minimal API architecture.

## Prerequisites
- .NET SDK (6.0 or later)
